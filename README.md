Risk assesment's for 2016.

- model.prediction.andmore.5may2017 contains all the code necessary to train the models used and to make the current predictions.  It contains some additional items, such as a test that trains on the data up through 1996 then tests on the later years to assess accuracy. (ROC_1996split.pdf is the result).

- EWP_final_data_31Oct2016.RData contains the fully pre-processed data used in the actual anlysis.  The procedure for constructing these data is long and intensive; contact us if you require details and replication materials to generate these data from source. 

- EWP Data Dictionary 20140909.pdf is a data dictionary.

NOTE:
We carried forward the 2014 codings for Israel for all data produced by the the Center for Systemic Peace in order to maintain consistency in coding across all of Israel’s independent variables and between the independent and dependent variables. In its 2015 data update, the Center for Systemic Peace (CSP), decided to redefine the “polity” of Israel as including the West Bank and Gaza. This change would have introduced measurement inconsistency with our dependent variable, which excludes the West Bank and Gaza, and independent variables from other sources (such as population, GDP, infant mortality and natural resources), all of which report data for Israel separately from the West Bank and Gaza. 

We used trade openness data from the 2015 CIA World Fact Book instead of the World Bank’s World Development Indicators for all countries that were missing trade openness data for 2015 and 2014. This applied to Angola, Cuba, Djibouti, Eritrea, the Gambia, Lesotho, Myanmar, North Korea, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone, the Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Syria, Tajikistan, Timor Leste, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Yemen.
